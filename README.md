# Education
## I started my QA journey with Manual Tester course in CodersLab school
### Course contained 3 days of ISTQB theory and then I learned 4 most common tools for manual testing like:

 <li>Jira</li>
  <li>Postman</li>
  <li>SoapUi</li>
 <li>MySQL</li>
 
 ### After many hours spent with the best teachers I gained new skills which are necessary to become Manual Tester, the most important are:
 
1. Test planning
2. Test management
3. Manual testing:
     - Functional tests
     - Regression tests
     - Confirmatory tests
